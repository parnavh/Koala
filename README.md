## Koala

This is a previously private repository hence the missing git history, this bot is under development and was made for no purpose other than having fun and catering to custom commands/actions and just goofing around

```
git clone https://github.com/parnav-originals/Koala.git
cd Koala
npm install
```

Make a file `config.json` which will contain your unique bot token which you can generate from https://discord.com/developers/applications, bot owner id for owner only commands, and your sudo guilds which is an array of guild ids in which sudo (owner only commands) will be allowed in, and also the default bot prefix

This Bot uses aws polly for voice related activity, you can create a free aws account and use it for a year for the same if you decide to do so create a service account and give it access to aws polly and download the client secret/credentials into a file named `config_aws.json`, else delete the voice related files (every file which contains vc or voice and every file in voice folder)

This bot also uses firebase to store configurations of any and all servers. For this you can make a free firebase project forever and initialize the firebase firestore and download the admin sdk credentials and store it as `config_firebase.json`. I would recommend against removing firebase functionality as this would mean that everytime the bot restarts, it has to be reconfigured

At this point, you should have 3 new files: 
#### config.json
```json
{
 "prefix" : "`",
 "token" : "ENTER YOUR TOKEN HERE",
 "owner" : "ENTER YOUR USER ID HERE",
 "sudo_guilds" : ["ENTER YOUR GUILD ID HERE"]
}
```
#### config_aws.json
```json
// This is the autogenerated file by aws
{
 "accessKeyId": "your access id",
 "secretAccessKey": "your secret",
 "region": "your region"
}
```
#### config_firebase.json
```json
// This is the autogenerated file by firebase
{
 "type": "",
 "project_id": "",
 "private_key_id": "",
 "private_key": "",
 "client_email": "",
 "client_id": "",
 "auth_uri": "",
 "token_uri": "",
 "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
 "client_x509_cert_url": ""
}
```

Once you have all these files in place, you can test the bot for any faults, I prefer nodemon for development, and can be installed using `npm install nodemon -g` and  then running `nodemon` or you can just do `npm start` without nodemon

If there are no apparent issues after some fiddling around, you can run the bot using a process manager like `pm2` which can be installed using `npm install pm2 -g` and then running `pm2 start` in the discord bot root. The settings are preconfigured in the `ecosystem.config.js` file and it will handle the rest.

If you want to restart the bot, you can list all the pm2 processes by running `pm2 list` and then restarting using `pm2 restart {pid}` {pid} being the process id found when doing `pm2 list`. 

For stopping the bot, the same pid will be used in `pm2 stop {pid}`

That's all, enjoy
